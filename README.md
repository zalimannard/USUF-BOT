The music bot we used was blocked by YouTube. As a local alternative, I made this bot. The project is made for educational purposes, all actions you do at your own risk. Using a bot to listen to Youtube videos is contrary to the [Terms of Service - II. Prohibitions](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service).
